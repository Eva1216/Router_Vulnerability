## 2. Permission bypass&Information disclosure

The vulnerability is similar to dir-815's vulnerability, when you access `getcfg.php` page with post data(no certification): `SERVICES=DEVICE.ACCOUNT&attack=ture%0aAUTHORIZED_GROUP=0` ,the router's username and password will be disclosed in the response result.

use the name and password, you can success login into the router admin manage page.

refer: https://github.com/iceMatcha/Some-Vulnerabilities-of-D-link-Dir815/blob/master/Vulnerabilities_Summary.md

and that, you can access other sensitive information with `SERVICES` parameter.

## 3. Login with blank password

The Admin account hava a default blank password in login page. The allows Attacker login with no password.
